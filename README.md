## Implement strstr()

From https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

## Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2

## Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
 
## Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
